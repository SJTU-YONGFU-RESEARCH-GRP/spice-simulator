# SPICE Simulator (schematic editor)

Public GitHub Pages host for the Vite schematic editor  
(local: `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` from the editor source tree).

**Site:** https://sjtu-yongfu-research-grp.github.io/spice-simulator/

## Develop

```bash
cd /mnt/d/proj/analog-canvas-js   # or spice-simulator-editor after rename
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @icm/editor dev
```

## Publish

```bash
cd /mnt/d/proj/spice-simulator
./scripts/publish-editor-pages.sh
./scripts/release.sh          # optional version tag
```

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `site/` | Built editor (Pages) |
| `scripts/publish-editor-pages.sh` | Build + commit `site/` |
| `scripts/release.sh` | Semver tag + GitHub Release |
| `docs/` | Dual-repo / lab notes |

Legacy vanilla MNA simulator code has been removed from this repository.

## Verify

`site/` is a checked-in build, so the checks that would normally run against
source have to run against the artifact instead. None of them need the editor
checkout or a package install:

```bash
node scripts/check-artifacts.mjs --accept=scripts/known-deviations.json
node scripts/smoke-test.mjs --require
node scripts/numeric-crosscheck.mjs
node scripts/numeric-crosscheck.negctl.mjs
```

or `npm run check:artifacts` / `npm run smoke` / `npm run check:numeric` /
`npm run check:numeric:neg`.

| Check | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| `check-artifacts.mjs` | Is the bundle self-consistent — do its references resolve, is there no development JSX runtime or folded-`undefined` call site? |
| `smoke-test.mjs` | Does the editor actually run — does a real simulation finish with zero uncaught errors? |
| `numeric-crosscheck.mjs` | Are the numbers **right** — does the shipped WASM agree with first-principles closed forms and with model-independent invariants (including for BSIM3/BSIM4, which have no closed form)? |
| `numeric-crosscheck.negctl.mjs` | Would the numeric guard **notice** if it broke? Mutates the guard and the deck and requires every mutant to fail. |

All four run in CI before `site/` is published.

Deviations that are known and attributable live in
`scripts/known-deviations.json`; they are printed with their reason, never
silently skipped, and an entry that stops matching is reported as a finding.
